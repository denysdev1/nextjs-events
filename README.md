# 🏂 Events App

An app that lets you view recent events, view all events, leave comments on events, search for events by date, and subscribe to the newsletter to stay up to date.

The app has a nice and highly interactive user interface and uses a lot of Next.js features (pre-rendering, API routes, image optimization, etc.).
